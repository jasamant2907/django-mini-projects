Create a simple App that use Angular and HTML5  that allows teachers to give
behavior points to students through a web interface.


Description
===========

Technologies/Libraries to use
1: Django
2: Python
3: TastyPie (NOT USED)
4: MongoDB
5: AngularJS (NOT USED)

The app should have 2 parts 
1: Giving points or marking behaviors  (Done coding used some jquery and fully functional)
2: Seeing the report or summary of all the behavior points for students, one row for
    each student sorted by date. (NOT Done NEEDS the tastypie to work for mongodb this
                                rest api will be consumed by angularjs in report form creation)
Currently I am not able to figure out how this is to be done to create rest api for mongodb using tastypie.
